## updating code to a more accessible version 

Recived source code to translate and refactor to a more accessable version of itself by making the elements more readable, adding in alt's to the images as well as changing some of the CSS to keep function. Doing so I have come away with a better understanding of how CSS and HTML interact with each other and how to mdeiate issues that could come from altering the class or id of an element.

## Usage

There are page links at the top that will direct to a diffrent portion of the page to reach one of the listed elements in the naviagtion bar.
